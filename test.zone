bsi.bund.de	1234	IN	A	213.73.89.123		; a IPv4 record

foo 		789	IN	AAAA	::123			; a IPv6 record

; some rules for the community and more ranting vs. ranting:

mail.oxff.net	3600	IN	A	46.4.99.131
grsecurity.net	3600	IN	A	173.10.160.233
grsecurity.net	3600	IN	MX	mail.oxff.net
www.kernel.org	7350	IN	A	173.10.160.233
kernel.org	7350	IN	A	173.10.160.233
kernel.org	7350	IN	CNAME	grsecurity.net		; nobody would ask for a CNAME, so an A RR is required

; TTL 1 is special and means only one reply per seen client source
; in order to demonstrate quantum-insert capability via DNS run
; acid.pl on 192.168.0.253:80
; due to a TTL of 1, it will expire in the resolver cache soon and the next lookup
; will reach its legit destination

*google.com	1	IN	a	192.168.0.253		; a wildcard match for this domain


; [forward] is a special name that pops in when nothing else matches
; it is a simplified SOA record with fixed serial number and min values

ns.google.com	1234	IN	A	8.8.8.8
[forward]	1234	IN	SOA	ns.google.com		; SOA records for NXDOMAIN


; end
