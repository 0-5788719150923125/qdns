; only IN class is honored (IN is case sensitive)
; comments are like this, separators are space(s) or tab(s)

; there are two types of RR's. Normal (matching) ones that specify a RR
; and link-RR starting with a '@' to indicate to which already existing
; RR this record is linked to as an additional answer. Only normal RR's
; are used for matching queries. link-RR's are _only_ used for chaining
; into existing matching-RR's. The RR that follows next-line to an @ RR
; is interpreated as the additional record.

; some funny rules

; name		TTL	IN	type	IP/dname
;
;

bsi.bund.de	1234	IN	A	213.73.89.123		; a IPv4 record
ccc.de		123	IN	NS	foo

; to save client from additional lookup, provide an AAAA RR
; along with the NS RR by linking the following AAAA RR to the matching NS RR
; from above:
@ccc.de	NS
foo 		789	IN	AAAA	::123			; a IPv6 record
@ccc.de NS
bar		123	IN	A	1.2.3.4

; some rules for the community and more ranting vs. ranting:

mail.oxff.net	3600	IN	A	46.4.99.131
grsecurity.net	3600	IN	A	173.10.160.233


; Above mail.oxff.net RR is also answered by queries for it. Now also link
; it to grsecurity.net's MX:
grsecurity.net	3600	IN	MX	mail.oxff.net
@grsecurity.net	MX
mail.oxff.net   3600    IN      A       46.4.99.131


kernel.org	7350	IN	A	173.10.160.233
@kernel.org	A
kernel.org	7350	IN	CNAME	grsecurity.net		; nobody would ask for a CNAME, so an A RR is required
@kernel.org	A
grsecurity.net	7350	IN	A	173.10.160.233


; demonstrate DNS rebind attack or load-balancing; for rebind the TTL should be shorter though
kernel.org	7350	IN	A	127.0.0.1
@kernel.org     A
yolo		1234	IN	CNAME	yala

_ldap._tcp.foo	1234	IN	SRV	ldap:389
@_ldap._tcp.foo	SRV
ldap		1234	IN	A	1.2.3.4

; TTL 1 is special and means only one reply per seen client source
; in order to demonstrate quantum-insert capability via DNS run
; acid.pl on 192.168.0.253:80
; due to a TTL of 1, it will expire in the resolver cache soon and the next lookup
; will reach its legit destination

*google.com	1	IN	a	192.168.0.253		; a wildcard match for this domain



; [forward] is a special name that pops in when nothing else matches
; it is a simplified SOA record with fixed serial number and min values
; afer linking in a SOA, you must not link in more RR's

[forward]	1234	IN	SOA	ns.google.com		; SOA records for NXDOMAIN
@[forward]	SOA
ns.google.com	1234	IN	A	8.8.8.8
